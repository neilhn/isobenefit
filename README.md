# Isobenefit lines

This is for the collaboration with Luca D'Acci on his proposed isobenefit line. The original proposal was to calculate benefit score of every point in space in a continuous manner, i.e. a benefit centre radially contributes to points around it. This version is to consider paths that follow the actual street network.
